Notes for this section in comments in code, but!

A variable declared outside of a function will have package level scope

A variable declared within a function will have block level scope

Imports have file level scope: import "fmt" in every file in which it is used

Closure:

Inner scopes can use variables from outside

Variables and functions initialized in an inner scope cannot be used in outer scopes

When defining a function inside a function the inner function has to be anonymous, Example:
increment := func() int {
  x++ 
  return x
}

rather than:

func increment() int {
  x++ 
  return x
}

A func expression is assigning a function to a variable
